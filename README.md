# Machine Learning Project Heart Disease Detection

***

## An Machine Learning project with hyperparameter tuning and Flask app creation

This project is a machine learning project made to detect heart disease from a simple physical test, the data is from kaggel [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). The reasearch done for this project is in [research folder](https://github.com/aashaybelekar/HeartDiseasePrediction/blob/main/research/heart-failure-ml-project.ipynb) or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aashaybelekar/heart-failure-ml-project). it includes the following phases of machine learning project:

* Research Phase
* Data Ingestion
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Transformation
* Model Building
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Flask App Creation
* Deployment
